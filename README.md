# üåé Catalogue of Languages

**Catalogue of Languages** is an interactive table featuring all documented languages from the Wikitongues database. Built on the [_Every Language in the World_](https://www.airtable.com/universe/exph5qycoKpX7tPwO/every-language-in-the-world) Airtable dataset, it provides an easy way to explore global linguistic diversity.

This project aims to make language research simple and accessible, serving as a resource for researchers, linguists, students, and enthusiasts.

üîó Live project: [catalogue-of-languages.vercel.app](https://catalogue-of-languages.vercel.app/)

It‚Äôs a React-based application with a dynamic and scalable table, featuring search and navigation capabilities. Designed with best practices in mind, it ensures easy integration of new features and adaptability for larger, production-ready systems.

## üåê API Overview

This project uses data from the Wikitongues [_Every Language in the World_](https://www.airtable.com/universe/exph5qycoKpX7tPwO/every-language-in-the-world) table, publicly available on Airtable. The API is based on a private copy of this dataset hosted in an Airtable workspace.

### API Endpoint Structure

Airtable API requests follow this structure:

```
https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableId}?maxRecords={maxRecordsNumber}
```

- `{baseId}` starts with `"app"`, `{tableId}` starts with `"tbl"`, and `{viewId}` starts with `"viw"`.
- Authentication is done via **Bearer Token**.

### Example Request

```http
GET https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableId}?maxRecords=10
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
