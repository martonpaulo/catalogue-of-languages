# üåé Catalogue of Languages

**Catalogue of Languages** is an interactive table featuring all documented languages from the Wikitongues database. Built on the [_Every Language in the World_](https://www.airtable.com/universe/exph5qycoKpX7tPwO/every-language-in-the-world) Airtable dataset, it provides an easy way to explore global linguistic diversity.

This project aims to make language research simple and accessible, serving as a resource for researchers, linguists, students, and enthusiasts.

## üîç Overview

### Scalability Considerations

This React-based application is built with scalability in mind. It features a dynamic, modular table with search and navigation capabilities, designed to integrate easily with new features and adapt to larger, production-ready systems. Key points include:

- Clean, reusable code and components to facilitate the addition of new features.
- Best practices in state management and API handling to accommodate future changes or new endpoints.
- A scalable folder structure that supports the growth of the codebase over time.

### User Experience

The project focuses on an intuitive and responsive UI design, ensuring smooth navigation across devices. Error handling is prioritized to gracefully manage API errors and loading states, guaranteeing a seamless experience for users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend Framework

**React + Next.js + TypeScript**

- Combines SSG and SSR for fast loading and optimized SEO.
- TypeScript enhances maintainability with static and safe typing.

### Styling

**Material UI + Material Icons**

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) compliant with ARIA attributes and accessible patterns.

### Data Fetching

**React Query**

- Simplifies API integration with caching, refetching, and performance enhancements.

### Linting

**ESLint**

- Enforces clean, consistent code by identifying and fixing potential issues.

### Deployment

**Vercel**

- Enables fast and scalable deployment with automatic builds and previews.

## üåê API Overview

This project uses data from the Wikitongues [_Every Language in the World_](https://www.airtable.com/universe/exph5qycoKpX7tPwO/every-language-in-the-world) table, publicly available on Airtable. The API is based on a private copy of this dataset hosted in an Airtable workspace.

### API Endpoint Structure

Airtable API requests follow this structure:

```
https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableId}?maxRecords={maxRecordsNumber}
```

- `{baseId}` starts with `"app"`, `{tableId}` starts with `"tbl"`, and `{viewId}` starts with `"viw"`.
- Authentication is done via **Bearer Token**.

### Example Request

```http
GET https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableId}?maxRecords=10
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

For more details, check the official [Airtable API documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/).
